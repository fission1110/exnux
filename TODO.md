- randomize metasploit postgres password
- Attempt to reduce size of image (currently ~12g) without compromising functionality
- Clean up neovim config and think out hotkeys better
- Find a better way to host/load completed image so we don't need to recompile on all systems
- Maybe switch to a modern plugin management system for vim plugins
- Fix permissions across host/vm mounts. Not sure of a good solution for this one.
    - Mounting /etc/passwd and /etc/group not a great option because all the things built inside of the Dockerfile will need to be chmoded (slow, balloons the image)
    - Changing the uid/gid isn't a great option for the same reason
- handle jar/apk files with procyon in vim
- Split out dotfiles into a sub-repo. Find a better way to handle cache files.
- Clean up the config.lua
- Port init.vim to lua scripts. Have one file with consistent keybindings.
- Split up apt-gets into specific tool scripts (without breaking parallal) to make it easier to get dependancies and add/remove tools
